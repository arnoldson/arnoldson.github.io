        Passionate about crafting seamless web experiences, I’m a web developer
        with a love for clean code and innovative design. When I’m not building
        websites, you’ll find me scaling new heights—both in coding challenges
        and on climbing walls. I thrive on problem-solving, adventure, and
        pushing limits in both worlds.
